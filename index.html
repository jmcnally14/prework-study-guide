    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>CSS=Cascading Style Sheets - is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
      <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: </li>
      <li>Inline CSS</li>
      <li>Internal CSS StyleSheet</li>
      <li>External CSS StyleSheet</li>
      <li>Inline CSS- When developers want to style an element directly in the HTML File. Used to apply a specific HTML tag using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
      <li>Internal CSS StyleSheet-  contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page & you can configure CSS classes & ID's whcih are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
      <li>External CSS StyleSheet - allows developers to keep all of their CSS rules in a separate file which makes design changes easier. **This is the most common way to style a webpage**</li>
      <li>Separation of Concerns: is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use - based on the idea each section of code should have its own responsibility</li>
      <li> * Selector - Special Wild Card Symbol = used when we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
      <li>DRY Coding (Do Not Repeat Yourself) is a principle that encourages developers to reuse/share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written/maintained. It also reduces the overall size & complexity of a codebase.</li>
      <li>Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process.</li>
      <li>Think of errors and mistakes are gifts - they tell us something is wrong we can figure out what is happening and learn something new at the same time</li>
      <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selection. It can then be assigned an HTML element eneabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the cSS rule.</li>
      <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways including by Semantic References like blue or gray, but can also be done by its Hexadecimal code or hex#</li>
